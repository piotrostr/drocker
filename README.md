# Drocker

CLI application for generating Dockerfile's, for Rust to start with

Inspired by go-zero `goctl` tool


# Goals 

- [x] Learn some Rust
- [] Learn how to containerize Rust applications
- [] 

# Desired Usage

```
drocker --rust
```

To automatically generate a Dockerfile

# Later

Other runtimes, like

```
drocker --node
```

But why would you ever use node if you generate your Dockerfile programmatically lol
